## leti-R Wiki page

This wiki is an attempt at structuring our research efforts in as structure-free an environment as possible!

------
### MkDocs

The goal was to find an easy tool that can be customized and can work with markdown documents. [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) provides these features. MkDocs works quite simply by using a .yaml file for configuration, and a folder of .md files to create pages for the wiki. It's  highly customizable and seems like a good candidate to address our needs. I also have not gone through the whole documentation or their [github repository](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/), so it may be that what I have found unsatisfying thus far has already been addressed.

------------------------
### Tagging in documents

The search function provided by MkDocs does not allow for strict searches (*e.g.* "ggplot2"). I therefore suggest adding a tags section for each document to facilitate indexation and search through the wiki, with all tags preceded by '\_' (\# doesn't work). It would give something like this:

#### Tags
\_Kévin;
\_Steve;
\_Nicolas
