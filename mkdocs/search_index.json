MkDocs works quite simply by using a .yaml file for configuration, and a folder of .md files to create pages for the wiki. It's  highly customizable and seems like a good candidate to address our needs. I also have not gone through the whole documentation or their \ngithub repository\n, so it may be that what I have found unsatisfying thus far has already been addressed.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nFor \nhomebrew\n users:\n\n\nbrew install mkdocs\n\n\n\n\nFor further details, you may visit the \nMkDocs\n website.\n\n\n\n\nTagging in documents\n\n\nThe search function provided by MkDocs does not allow for strict searches (\ne.g.\n \"ggplot2\"). I therefore suggest adding a tags section for each document to facilitate indexation and search through the wiki, with all tags preceded by '_' (# doesn't work).
